<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Tom-Eric Gerritsen. I am co-founder and lead-developer at <a href="http://www.eet.nu/" title="Restaurantgids Eet.nu">Eet.nu</a>. I <a href="https://github.com/tomeric" title="Tom-Eric's GitHub Profile">love programming</a> and all other aspects of development.</p>

<p>You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tomeric" title="@tomeric">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://alpha.app.net/tomeric" title="@tomeric">App.net</a> and email me at <a href="mailto:ik@tom-eric.info">ik@tom-eric.info</a>.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<h3>Sound Campaign</h3>

<p><a href="http://soundcampaign.com/">Sound Campaign</a> is a new project I am working on with <a href="http://gordonjakob.me/">Gordon Hatusupy</a> and <a href="http://sebastiaanbeek.nl/">Sebastiaan Beek</a>. It's an online promotion service for music professionals and labels. Our goal is to improve the relationships between labels and music professionals. We do this by making it easy for labels to send attractive promo's that music professionals will be happy to receive and give feedback on.</p>

<p>We've recently started a private beta and hope to launch in 2014.</p>

<h3>Eet.nu</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gerard76">Gerard Leijdekkers</a> and I relaunched <a href="http://en.eet.nu/">the restaurant guide Eet.nu</a> in 2009 and turned it from a side project into a profitable business. It's now the largest restaurant guide in The Netherlands and we have a growing team of passionate people with which we are working on great stuff.</p>

<p>Because we are a technology driven company we thrive to do all of our development in-house. I primarily work on our backend, but together with our designers I've also worked on a new responsive design, done a lot of work to localise our website and contributed code to our iOS app.</p>

<p>We love open source and try to <a href="https://github.com/eet-nu">contribute back to the community</a> whenever we can. Some of the open source projects I've worked on are: <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on">acts-as-taggable-on</a>, <a href="https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3">globalize3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">kss</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eet-nu/buckaroo-ideal">buckaroo-ideal</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eet-nu/cheers">cheers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eet-nu/transliterator">transliterator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eet-nu/normalize">normalize</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in working with us, please <a href="mailto:tomeric@eet.nu">send me an email</a>.</p>

<h2>Past</h2>

<p>In 2007 I became a partner of <a href="http://www.i76.nl/">i76</a>, a small web development consultancy shop. Together with my partners we worked on several Ruby on Rails and PHP projects for our clients while we tried to earn enough money to justify working on side projects full-time.</p>

<p>Before that I worked for <a href="http://www.bkgateway.com/">BKGateway</a>, a small IT company that specialised in facilitating communication between industrial systems.</p>
