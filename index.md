# Bio

Hi! My name is Tom-Eric Gerritsen. I am co-founder and lead-developer at [Eet.nu]. I [love programming][My GitHub Account] and all other aspects of development.

You can follow me on [Twitter][My Twitter Account] or [App.net][My ADN Account] and email me at [ik@tom-eric.info](mailto:ik@tom-eric.info).

## Work at Eet.nu

Gerard Leijdekkers and I relaunched [the Dutch restaurant guide Eet.nu][Eet.nu] in 2009 and turned it from a side project into a profitable business. It's now the largest restaurant guide in The Netherlands and we have a growing team of passionate people with which we are working on great stuff.

Because we are a technology driven company we thrive to do all of our development in-house. I primarily work on our backend, but together with our designers I've also worked on a new responsive design, done a lot of work to localise our website and contributed code to our iOS app.

We love open source and try to [contribute back to the community][Eet.nu GitHub Organization] whenever we can. Some of the open source projects I've worked on are: [acts-as-taggable-on], [globalize3], [kss], [buckaroo-ideal], [cheers], [transliterator] and [normalize].

If you are interested in working for us, please send me an email at [tomeric@eet.nu](mailto:tomeric@eet.nu).

## Work before Eet.nu

In 2007 I became a partner of [i76], a small web development consultancy shop. Together with my partners we worked on several Ruby on Rails and PHP projects for our clients while we tried to earn enough money to justify working on side projects full-time.

Before that I worked for [BKGateway], a small IT company that specialised in facilitating communication between industrial systems.
